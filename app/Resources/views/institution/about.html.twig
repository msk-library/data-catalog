  <h1>About the Data Catalog</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to the MSK Data Catalog, a searchable and browsable online collection of records describing the contents of datasets and providing access instructions for those wishing to explore the data for their own research. As a user, the data catalog is designed to help you identify data resources that may inform your project or research question. Some data resources may be immediately available to you from the catalog. Others may require you to complete a data use application form, contact the data set owner, or otherwise engage in collaborations with other investigators or data “owners.”
</p>
<h2>What is the Data Catalog?</h2>
<p>
  The data catalog is a digital way-finder designed to enhance discoverability and maximize the usefulness of datasets through rich metadata: description, keywords, data formats, instrumentation or software utilized in the creation of the data, and access information. It also connects researchers to data authors and experts to promote greater exposure and reuse of data while providing appropriate protections for authors.
  The Data Catalog is NOT a data repository to store data, but rather a gateway to datasets stored in internal and external repositories. Our current inclusion criteria for this catalog are:
<ul>
  <li>Internal datasets created by MSK researchers and attached to a publication, </li>
  <li>Internal datasets created by MSK researchers but unpublished or pre-published,</li>
  <li>External datasets referenced by MSK researchers in pursuit of their research/publication</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in submitting a dataset to the MSK Data Catalog, have a suggestion for additional datasets to add, or are willing to serve as a local expert, please <a href="https://beta.datacatalog.mskcc.org/contact-us"> Contact Us</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the MSK Data Catalog:
<ul>
  <li>Increase the visibility of research data generated by MSK researchers,</li>
  <li>Aggregate access to MSK datasets from one location,</li>
  <li>Facilitate collaboration across MSK labs and departments,</li>
  <li>Support the process of re-using research data,</li>
  <li>Identify access points, experts, or owners of MSK datasets,</li>
  <li>Help MSK researchers locate and understand datasets generated at external organizations,</li>
  <li>Maintain a gateway for access while respecting embargos and protecting the rights of data creators,</li>
  <li>Enhance the information in the Synapse [synapse link] collection of MSK author profiles and publications.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  While the cataloged datasets represent MSK data, they do not include all publicly available, licensed, or private external datasets. If you would like assistance in conducting a more comprehensive search of all datasets accessible through the library, please <a href="mailto:asklibrarian@mskcc.org">contact us</a>.
